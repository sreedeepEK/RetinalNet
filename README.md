## Retinal OCT Analysis using Pretrained ResNet50

This repository contains the implementation of a Retinal OCT analysis system using a pretrained ResNet50 model. The system is based on utilizing transfer learning with ResNet50 for efficient analysis of Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images.

### Important Notes
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the OpticNet paper for educational purposes. It's recommended to train for more epochs (e.g., 50) for potentially better results. In my testing, 5 epochs took approximately 4 hours. Training for longer will require more computational resources and time.

This is a replication of the core functionalities described in the Optic-Net paper, but may not include all the optimizations or complexities of the original research.

Contributions are welcome!
